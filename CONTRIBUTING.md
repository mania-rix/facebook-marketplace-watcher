## Open *helpâ€‘wanted* tasks

- **Cookie reuse** â€“ save & reload session cookies instead of logging in each run.  
- **Randomised delays** â€“ jitter sleep intervalâ€¯/â€¯userâ€‘agent to mimic humans.  
- **Better secret handling** â€“ switch to `.env` +â€¯`pythonâ€‘dotenv` (no creds in code).  
- **Dockerfile** â€“ selfâ€‘contained runner with Mailhog for email testing.  
- **Unit tests** â€“ isolate `process_listing()` logic with static HTML fixtures.  

Feel free to suggest more!
